        "with a focus on how advances in training, increased pitch velocity, and changes in game philosophy have influenced "
        "hitter roles. Using a combination of **machine learning**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **trend analysis**, "
        "we compare decades of hitting data to examine whether the line between **power hitters** and **contact hitters** has blurred."

        - **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**: Using **PCA** and **TSNE** to visualize and group hitters and decades by performance metrics
        - **Trend Analysis**: Observing decade-by-decade and yearly changes in **batting average**, **slugging percentage**, **strikeout rate**, etc
        - **Historical and Type Comparison**: Contrasting modern hitters with those from earlier decades to identify evolving archetypes, and contact vs power hitters
        - **Chatbot trained on dataset available to answer all questions baseball or completely unrelated
