        "This thesis investigates how Major League Baseball (MLB) hitters have changed from **1950 to the present day**, "
        "with a focus on how advances in training, increased pitch velocity, and changes in game philosophy have influenced "
        "hitter roles. Using a combination of **machine learning**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **trend analysis**, "
        "we compare decades of hitting data to examine whether the line between **power hitters** and **contact hitters** has blurred."

        "The central aim is to **quantify how hitter profiles and offensive trends have evolved** over time and to determine the "

        ### Key Questions:
        - **Have power hitters become more dominant while contact hitters have declined?**
        - **Do modern hitters focus more on exit velocity and launch angle than batting average?**
        - **Is there a correlation between rising fastball velocity and changes in offensive outcomes‚Äîor injury rates?**
        - **What role has sports science and analytics played in reshaping hitter development and success?**

        - **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**: Using **PCA** and **TSNE** to visualize and group hitters by performance metrics.
        - **Trend Analysis**: Observing decade-by-decade changes in **batting average**, **slugging percentage**, **strikeout rate**, and **home run rate**.
        - **Velocity Correlation Study**: Linking increasing average **pitch velocities** to hitter performance and possible injury trends.
        - **Historical Comparison**: Contrasting modern hitters with those from earlier decades to identify evolving archetypes.
